                    <p>The structure is pyramidal, and the vertex coincides with Mary's head. The statue widens
                        progressively down the drapery of Mary's dress, to the base, the rock of Golgotha. The figures
                        are quite out of proportion, owing to the difficulty of depicting a fully-grown man cradled
                        full-length in a woman's lap. Much of Mary's body is concealed by her monumental drapery, and
                        the relationship of the figures appears quite natural. Michelangelo's interpretation of the
                        Pietà was far different from those previously created by other artists, as he sculpted a young
                        and beautiful Mary rather than an older woman around 45 years of age.</p>
                    <p>The marks of the Crucifixion are limited to very small nail marks and an indication of the wound
                        in Jesus' side.</p>
                    <p>Christ's face does not reveal signs of the Passion. Michelangelo did not want his version of the
                        Pietà to represent death, but rather to show the "religious vision of abandonment and a serene
                        face of the Son,"thus the representation of the communion between man and God by the
                        sanctification through Christ. </p>
                    <p>When Michelangelo set out to create his Pietà, he wanted to create a work he described as "the
                        heart's image".</p>

                    <h3 class="display-2">Youthfulness of Mary</h3>
                    <p>The Madonna is represented as being very young for the mother of an approximately 33-year-old
                        son, which is not uncommon in depictions of the Passion of Christ at the time. Various
                        explanations have been suggested for this. One is that her youth symbolizes her incorruptible
                        purity, as Michelangelo himself said to his biographer and fellow sculptor Ascanio Condivi:</p>
                    <p>"Do you not know that chaste women stay fresh much more than those who are not chaste? How much
                        more in the case of the Virgin, who had never experienced the least lascivious desire that might
                        change her body?"</p>
                    <p>Another explanation suggests that Michelangelo's treatment of the subject was influenced by his
                        passion for Dante's Divine Comedy: so well-acquainted was he with the work that when he went to
                        Bologna, he paid for hospitality by reciting verses from it. In Paradiso (cantica 33 of the
                        poem), Saint Bernard, in a prayer for the Virgin Mary, says "Vergine madre, figlia del tuo
                        figlio" (Virgin mother, daughter of your son). This is said because, since Christ is one of the
                        three figures of Trinity, Mary would be his daughter, but it is also she who bore him. </p>

                    <p>The ceiling's various painted elements form part of a larger scheme of decoration within the
                        Chapel, which includes the large fresco The Last Judgement on the sanctuary wall, also by
                        Michelangelo, wall paintings by several leading painters of the late 15th century including
                        Sandro Botticelli, Domenico Ghirlandaio and Pietro Perugino, and a set of large tapestries by
                        Raphael, the whole illustrating much of the doctrine of the Catholic Church.</p>
                    <p>Central to the ceiling decoration are nine scenes from the Book of Genesis, of which The Creation
                        of Adam is the best known, having an iconic standing equalled only by Leonardo da Vinci's Mona
                        Lisa, the hands of God and Adam being reproduced in countless imitations. The complex design
                        includes several sets of individual figures, both clothed and nude, which allowed Michelangelo
                        to fully demonstrate his skill in creating a huge variety of poses for the human figure and
                        which have provided an enormously influential pattern book of models for other artists ever

                    <h3 class="display-2">Context and history</h3>
                    <p>The walls of the Sistine Chapel had been decorated 20 years before Michelangelo's work on the
                        ceiling. The lowest of three levels is painted to resemble draped hangings and was (and
                        sometimes still is) hung on special occasions with a set of tapestries designed by Raphael. The
                        middle level contains a complex scheme of frescoes illustrating the Life of Christ on the right
                        side and the Life of Moses on the left side. It was carried out by some of the most renowned
                        Renaissance painters: Sandro Botticelli, Domenico Ghirlandaio, Pietro Perugino, Pinturicchio,
                        Luca Signorelli and Cosimo Rosselli. The upper level of the walls contains the windows, between
                        which are painted pairs of illusionistic niches with representations of the first 32 popes.</p>
                    <p>The original ceiling painting was by Pier Matteo d'Amelia, and had depicted stars over a blue
                        background like the ceiling of the Arena Chapel decorated by Giotto at Padua. For six months in
                        1504, a diagonal crack in the chapel's vault had made the chapel unusable, and Pope Julius II
                        (Giuliano della Rovere) had the damaged painting removed by Piero Roselli, a friend of
                        Michelangelo's. Julius II was a "warrior pope" who in his papacy undertook an aggressive
                        campaign for political control to unite and empower Italy under the leadership of the Catholic
                        Church. He invested in symbolism to display his temporal power, such as his procession, in which
                        he (in the Classical manner) rode a chariot through a triumphal arch after one of his many
                        military victories. Julius II's project to rebuild St. Peter's Basilica would distinguish it as
                        the most potent symbol of the source of papal power; he ultimately demolished and replaced the
                        original basilica with a grander one intended to house his own tomb. The pope summoned
                        Michelangelo to Rome in early 1505 and commissioned him to design his tomb, forcing the artist
                        to leave Florence with his planned Battle of Cascina painting unfinished. By this time,
                        Michelangelo was established as an artist; both he and Julius II had hot tempers and soon
                        argued. On 17 April 1506, Michelangelo left Rome in secret for Florence, remaining there until
                        the Florentine government pressed him to return to the pope.</p>

                    <p>Michelangelo's depiction of the Madonna and Child differs significantly from earlier
                        representations of the same subject, which tended to feature a pious Virgin smiling down on an
                        infant held in her arms. Instead, Jesus stands upright, almost unsupported, only loosely
                        restrained by Mary's left hand, and appears to be about to step away from his mother. Meanwhile,
                        Mary does not cling to her son or even look at him, but gazes down and away. It is believed the
                        work was originally intended for an altar piece. If this is so, then it would have been
                        displayed facing slightly to the right and looking down. The early 16th-century sculpture also
                        displays the High Renaissance Pyramid style frequently seen in the works of Leonardo da Vinci
                        during the late 1400s.</p>
                    <p>Madonna and Child shares certain similarities with Michelangelo's Pietà, which was completed
                        shortly before – mainly, the chiaroscuro effect and movement of the drapery. The long, oval face
                        of Mary is also reminiscent of the Pietà. </p>

                    <h3 class="display-2">Description</h3>
                    <p>The work is also notable in that it was the first sculpture by Michelangelo to leave Italy during
                        his lifetime. In 1504, it was bought by Giovanni and Alessandro Moscheroni (Mouscron), who were
                        wealthy cloth merchants in Bruges, then one of the leading commercial cities in Europe. The
                        sculpture was sold for 4,000 florins. </p>
                    <p>The sculpture was removed twice from Belgium after its initial arrival. The first was in 1794
                        after French Revolutionaries had conquered the Austrian Netherlands during the French
                        Revolutionary Wars; the citizens of Bruges were ordered to ship it and several other valuable
                        works of art to Paris. It was returned after Napoleon's final defeat at Waterloo in 1815. The
                        second removal was in 1944, during World War II, with the retreat of German soldiers, who
                        smuggled the sculpture to Germany enveloped in mattresses in a Red Cross truck. It was
                        discovered a year later in Altaussee, Austria within a salt mine and again returned. It now sits
                        in the Church of Our Lady in Bruges, Belgium. This is represented in the 2014 film The Monuments

                    <p>The Torment of Saint Anthony (or The Temptation of Saint Anthony, c. 1487–88) is the earliest
                        known painting by Michelangelo, painted as a close copy of the famous engraving by Martin
                        Schongauer when he was only 12 or 13 years old. It is now in the Kimbell Art Museum in Fort
                        Worth, Texas. It shows the common medieval subject, included in the Golden Legend and
                        other sources, of Saint Anthony (AD 251 – 356) being assailed in the desert by demons, whose
                        temptations he resisted; the Temptation of St Anthony (or "Trial") is the more common name of
                        the subject. But this composition apparently shows a later episode where St Anthony, normally
                        flown about the desert supported by angels, was ambushed in mid-air by devils.</p>

                <div class="col-12 col-lg-8">
                    <p>Giorgio Vasari in his Lives of the Artists noted that Michelangelo had painted St. Anthony after
                        a print by Schongauer, and Ascanio Condivi recorded that Michelangelo had gone to a market to
                        draw fish scales, a feature not present in the original engraving. Besides this enhancement,
                        Michelangelo also added a landscape below the figures, and altered the expression of the saint.

                    <p>Pope Julius II commissioned Michelangelo to build his tomb in 1505 and it was finally completed
                        in 1545; Julius II died in 1513. The initial design by Michelangelo was massive and called for
                        over 40 statues. The statue of Moses would have been placed on a tier about 3.74 meters high (12
                        ft 3 in), opposite a figure of St. Paul. In the final design, the statue of Moses sits in the
                        center of the bottom tier. </p>

                    <h3 class="display-2">Description</h3>
                    <p>Giorgio Vasari in the Life of Michelangelo wrote: "Michelangelo finished the Moses in marble, a
                        statue of five braccia, unequaled by any modern or ancient work. Seated in a serious attitude,
                        he rests with one arm on the tablets, and with the other holds his long glossy beard, the hairs,
                        so difficult to render in sculpture, being so soft and downy that it seems as if the iron chisel
                        must have become a brush. The beautiful face, like that of a saint and mighty prince, seems as
                        one regards it to need the veil to cover it, so splendid and shining does it appear, and so well
                        has the artist presented in the marble the divinity with which God had endowed that holy
                        countenance. The draperies fall in graceful folds, the muscles of the arms and bones of the
                        hands are of such beauty and perfection, as are the legs and knees, the feet were adorned with
                        excellent shoes, that Moses may now be called the friend of God more than ever, since God has
                        permitted his body to be prepared for the resurrection before the others by the hand of
                        Michelangelo. The Jews still go every Saturday in troops to visit and adore it as a divine, not
                        a human thing."</p>
                    <p>The English translation of Sigmund Freud's "The Moses of Michelangelo" also provides a basic
                        description of the sculpture: "The Moses of Michelangelo is represented as seated; his body
                        faces forward, his head with its mighty beard looks to the left, his right foot rests on the
                        ground, and his left leg is raised so that only the toes touch the ground. His right arm links
                        the Tables of the Law with something that looks like a book in the right palm of his hand with a
                        portion of his beard; his left arm lies in his lap."</p>
                    <p>Jonathan Jones of the English newspaper, The Guardian, provides another description: "Moses's
                        right hand protects the stone tablets bearing the Commandments; his left hand, veins throbbing,
                        muscles tense, appears to be holding back from the violent action. When he came down from Mount
                        Sinai, Moses found his people worshipping the Golden Calf - the false idol they had made. His
                        anger defies the prison of stone, the limits of the sculptor's art. Few can resist the
                        impression of a real mind, real emotions, in the figure that glares from his marble seat. Today,
                        he glares at the tourists who mob the church of San Pietro in Vincoli, Rome. He outfaces them,
                        just as he outfaced Sigmund Freud, who spent three weeks in 1913 trying to figure out the
                        sculpture's emotional effect. Moses's vitality has made this work popular since the 16th
                        century; according to Vasari, Rome's Jewish population adopted the statue as their own. Its
                        power must have something to do with the rendition of things that should be impossible to depict
                        in stone; most quirkily, the beard - so ropy and smoky, its coils gave fantastic, snaking life.
                        But where others might astonish us with technique, Michelangelo goes beyond this, leading us
                        from formal to intellectual surprise, making us wonder why Moses fondles his beard, why
                        Michelangelo has used this river of hair - in combination with the horns that were a
                        conventional attribute of Moses - to give him an inhuman, demonic aspect."</p>

                <div class="col-12 col-lg-4">
                    <p>The work took over four years to complete between 1536 and 1541 (preparation of the altar wall
                        began in 1535). Michelangelo began working on it 25 years after having finished the Sistine
                        Chapel ceiling, and was nearly 67 at its completion. He had originally accepted the commission
                        from Pope Clement VII, but it was completed under Pope Paul III whose stronger reforming views
                        probably affected the final treatment.</p>
                    <p>In the lower part of the fresco, Michelangelo followed tradition in showing the saved ascending
                        at the left and the damned descending at the right. In the upper part, the inhabitants of Heaven
                        are joined by the newly saved. The fresco is more monochromatic than the ceiling frescoes and is
                        dominated by the tones of flesh and sky. The cleaning and restoration of the fresco, however,
                        revealed a greater chromatic range than previously apparent. Orange, green, yellow, and blue are
                        scattered throughout, animating and unifying the complex scene. </p>
                    <p>The reception of the painting was mixed from the start, with much praise but also criticism on
                        both religious and artistic grounds. Both the amount of nudity and the muscular style of the
                        bodies has been one area of contention, and the overall composition another. </p>
                </div>

                    <p>Where traditional compositions generally contrast an ordered, harmonious heavenly world above
                        with the tumultuous events taking place in the earthly zone below, in Michelangelo's conception
                        the arrangement and posing of the figures across the entire painting give an impression of
                        agitation and excitement, and even in the upper parts there is "a profound disturbance, tension
                        and commotion" in the figures. Sydney J. Freedberg interprets their "complex responses" as
                        "those of giant powers here made powerless, bound by racking spiritual anxiety", as their role
                        of intercessors with the deity had come to an end, and perhaps they regret some of the verdicts.
                        There is an impression that all the groups of figures are circling the central figure of Christ
                        in a huge rotary movement.</p>
                    <p>At the centre of the work is Christ, shown as the individual verdicts of the Last Judgment are
                        pronounced; he looks down towards the damned. He is beardless, and "compounded from antique
                        conceptions of Hercules, Apollo, and Jupiter Fulminator", probably, in particular, the Belvedere
                        Apollo, brought to the Vatican by Pope Julius II. However, there are parallels for his pose in
                        earlier Last Judgments, especially one in the Camposanto of Pisa, which Michelangelo would have
                        known; here the raised hand is part of a gesture of ostentatio vulnerum ("display of the
                        wounds"), where the resurrected Christ reveals the wounds of his Crucifixion, which can be seen
                        on Michelangelo's figure.</p>
                    <p>To the left of Christ is his mother, Virgin Mary, who turns her head to look down towards the
                        Saved, though her pose also suggests resignation. It appears that the moment has passed for her
                        to exercise her traditional role of pleading on behalf of the dead; with John the Baptist this
                        Deesis is a regular motif in earlier compositions. Preparatory drawings show her standing and
                        facing Christ with arms outstretched, in a more traditional intercessory posture.</p>
