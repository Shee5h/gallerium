                <div class="col-12 col-lg-4">
                    <p>The painting is probably of the Italian noblewoman Lisa Gherardini, the wife of Francesco del
                        Giocondo. It is painted in oil on a white Lombardy poplar panel. Leonardo never gave the
                        painting to the Giocondo family, and later it is believed he left it in his will to his favored
                        apprentice Salaì. It had been believed to have been painted between 1503 and 1506; however,
                        Leonardo may have continued working on it as late as 1517. It was acquired by King Francis I of
                        France and is now the property of the French Republic. It has been on permanent display at the
                        Louvre, Paris since 1797.</p>
                    <p>The Mona Lisa is one of the most valuable paintings in the world. It holds the Guinness World
                        Record for the highest known painting insurance valuation in history at US$100 million in 1962
                        (equivalent to $870 million in 2021). </p>

                    <h3 class="display-2">Description</h3>
                    <p>The Mona Lisa bears a strong resemblance to many Renaissance depictions of the Virgin Mary, who
                        was at that time seen as an ideal for womanhood. The woman sits markedly upright in a "pozzetto"
                        armchair with her arms folded, a sign of her reserved posture. Her gaze is fixed on the
                        observer. The woman appears alive to an unusual extent, which Leonardo achieved by his method of
                        not drawing outlines (sfumato). The soft blending creates an ambiguous mood "mainly in two
                        features: the corners of the mouth, and the corners of the eyes".</p>
                    <p>The depiction of the sitter in three-quarter profile is similar to late 15th-century works by
                        Lorenzo di Credi and Agnolo di Domenico del Mazziere. Zöllner notes that the sitter's general
                        position can be traced back to Flemish models and that "in particular the vertical slices of
                        columns at both sides of the panel had precedents in Flemish portraiture." Woods-Marsden cites
                        Hans Memling's portrait of Benedetto Portinari (1487) or Italian imitations such as Sebastiano
                        Mainardi's pendant portraits for the use of a loggia, which has the effect of mediating between
                        the sitter and the distant landscape, a feature missing from Leonardo's earlier portrait of
                        Ginevra de' Benci.</p>
                    <p>The painting was one of the first portraits to depict the sitter in front of an imaginary
                        landscape, and Leonardo was one of the first painters to use aerial perspective. The enigmatic
                        woman is portrayed seated in what appears to be an open loggia with dark pillar bases on either
                        side. Behind her, a vast landscape recedes to icy mountains. Winding paths and a distant bridge
                        give only the slightest indications of human presence. Leonardo has chosen to place the horizon
                        line not at the neck, as he did with Ginevra de' Benci, but on a level with the eyes, thus
                        linking the figure with the landscape and emphasizing the mysterious nature of the painting.</p>

                <div class="col-12 col-lg-4">
                    <p>The work was commissioned as part of a plan of renovations to the church and its convent
                        buildings by Leonardo's patron Ludovico Sforza, Duke of Milan. In order to permit his
                        inconsistent painting schedule and frequent revisions, it is painted with materials that allowed
                        for regular alterations: tempera on gesso, pitch, and mastic. Due to the methods used, a variety
                        of environmental factors, and intentional damage, little of the original painting remains today
                        despite numerous restoration attempts, the last being completed in 1999. Housed in the refectory
                        of the Convent of Santa Maria delle Grazie in Milan, Italy, The Last Supper is his largest work,
                        aside from the Sala delle Asse. </p>

                    <h3 class="display-2">Commission and creation</h3>
                    <p>The Last Supper measures 460 cm × 880 cm (180 in × 350 in) and covers an end wall of the dining
                        hall at the monastery of Santa Maria delle Grazie in Milan, Italy. The theme was a traditional
                        one for refectories, although the room was not a refectory at the time that Leonardo painted it.
                        The main church building was being completed (in 1498). Leonardo's patron, Ludovico Sforza,
                        planned that the church should be remodeled as a family mausoleum, and to this end, changes were
                        made, perhaps to plans by Bramante; these plans were not fully carried out, and a smaller
                        mortuary chapel was constructed, adjacent to the cloister. The painting was commissioned by
                        Sforza to decorate the wall of the mausoleum. The lunettes above the main painting, formed by
                        the triple arched ceiling of the refectory, are painted with Sforza coats-of-arms. The opposite
                        wall of the refectory is covered by the Crucifixion fresco by Giovanni Donato da Montorfano, to
                        which Leonardo added figures of the Sforza family in tempera; these figures have deteriorated in
                        much the same way as has The Last Supper.</p>
                    <p>Leonardo worked on The Last Supper from about 1495 to 1498, but did not work continuously. The
                        beginning date is not certain, as the archives of the convent for the period have been
                        destroyed. A document dated 1497 indicates that the painting was nearly completed at that date.
                        One story goes that a prior from the monastery complained to Leonardo about its delay, enraging
                        him. He wrote to the head of the monastery, explaining he had been struggling to find the
                        perfect villainous face for Judas, and that if he could not find a face corresponding with what
                        he had in mind, he would use the features of the prior who had complained.</p>
                    <p>In 1557, Gian Paolo Lomazzo wrote that Leonardo's friend Bernardo Zenale advised him to leave
                        Christ's face unfinished, arguing that "it would be impossible to imagine faces lovelier or
                        gentler than those of James the Greater or James the Less." Leonardo apparently took the advice.

                    <p>It is thought that Leonardo da Vinci drew this self-portrait at about the age of 60. The portrait
                        has been extensively reproduced and has become an iconic representation of Leonardo as a
                        polymath or "Renaissance Man". Despite this, some historians and scholars disagree as to the
                        true identity of the sitter. </p>

                    <h3 class="display-2">Description and provenance</h3>
                    <p>The portrait is drawn in red chalk on paper. It depicts the head of an elderly man in
                        three-quarter view, his face turned towards the viewer. The subject is distinguished by his long
                        hair and long waving beard which flow over the shoulders and chest. The length of the hair and
                        beard is uncommon in Renaissance portraits and suggests, as now, a person of sagacity. The face
                        has a somewhat aquiline nose and is marked by deep lines on the brow and pouches below the eyes.
                        It appears as if the man has lost his upper front teeth, causing deepening of the grooves from
                        the nostrils. The eyes of the figure do not engage the viewer but gaze ahead, veiled by the long
                        eyebrows. The drawing has been drawn in fine unique lines, shadowed by hatching and executed
                        with the left hand, as was Leonardo's habit. The paper has brownish "fox marks" caused by the
                        accumulation of iron salts due to moisture.</p>
                    <p>In 1839, Giovanni Volpato, an antiques dealer who may have purchased the drawing in England or
                        France, sold it to Prince Charles Albert of Sardinia with other drawings of great artists such
                        as Raphael and Michelangelo. It is housed in Turin, at the Royal Library, and is not generally
                        viewable by the public due to its fragility and poor condition. Researchers have developed a
                        nondestructive way to gauge the condition of the drawing by describing and quantifying the
                        chromophores affecting the paper. Their technique, described in Applied Physics Letters (2014),

                    <p>There is no real consensus on the subject, date, history, or purpose of the painting. It shows an
                        unidentified woman gazing downward while her hair fills the frame behind her. Many theories
                        regarding the subject have been proposed: that it is a sketch for an uncompleted painting of
                        Saint Anne; a study for the London version of the Virgin of the Rocks or Leonardo's lost
                        painting of Leda and the Swan; or a painting left deliberately unfinished for its aesthetic
                        value. </p>

                    <p>The painting was recorded in the sale in 1826 of Gaetano Callani's collection to the Galleria
                        Nazionale di Parma, the museum in which it is currently housed, but proof of its existence may
                        date back to 1531, when it may have been possessed by Isabella d'Este. Although many studies of
                        Leonardo's oeuvre are silent on the issue, most scholars who discuss the painting regard it as
                        an autographic work by Leonardo da Vinci and it has been listed as such in various major
                        Leonardo exhibitions. </p>

                    <h3 class="display-2">Composition</h3>
                    <p>TThe painting was executed in oils on a somewhat small, 54 × 39 cm (21 × 15 in) walnut wood
                        panel. It depicts a half-height woman turned toward her right at a three-quarter angle, but with
                        her face turned toward her left. The animal in her arms twists in a similar manner, resulting in
                        considerable contrapposto with the lady, a technique Leonardo explored earlier with the angel in
                        the Virgin of the Rocks. The work is prepared with a layer of white gesso and a layer of
                        brownish underpaint. In general, the paint is evenly applied akin to the Mona Lisa, though
                        certain areas of the lady's skin are more layered. Also present are the subtle remains of
                        spolvero (in the outline of the face and head), underdrawing (in the right arm, right hand, left
                        hand, top of nose and edge of the hair), and fingerprints (the face and animal's head), the
                        latter of which are particularly common in Leonardo's paintings. It is made from a single piece
                        of walnut wood; Leonardo recommended, and favored walnut wood, though it was not commonly used
                        by other artists in Lombardy. The wood is thin (about 4–5 millimetres (0.16–0.20 in)) and is
                        most likely from the same tree as the wood for his later portrait, La Belle Ferronnière. The
                        Lady with an Ermine is also connected to La Belle Ferronnière, as well as Leonardo's earlier
                        Portrait of a Musician, due to the three paintings including black backgrounds.</p>
                    <p>Though there are a few areas of minor damage, art historian Frank Zöllner insists the work is in
                        "very good condition... similar to the equally well preserved Mona Lisa". Such evaluation is
                        relatively recent, however, as the work was previously considered to be considerably damaged and
                        repainted. Promotion of such analysis largely began with the art historian Kenneth Clark, who
                        asserted in 1961 that the entire left side of the figure, as well as the background had been
                        repainted. Scholars such as Adolfo Venturi, Angela Ottino della Chiesa and Jack Wasserman
                        advanced the idea; however, 1992 technical analysis at the National Gallery of Art led by David
                        Bull has confirmed that the damaged was limited to the background. Specifically, the background
                        was likely originally a bluish-grey, overpainted with black during the mid 18th century. The
                        signature LEONARD D'AWINCI in the top left corner was probably also added at this time. There is
                        also slight overpainting in the mouth and nose; some art historians suggest Eugène Delacroix was
                        responsible for the overpaint in the background and elsewhere. The background was also subject
                        to the misconception that it originally included a window. It was proposed by Kazimierz
                        Kwiatkowski, who led 1955 X-ray testing at Warsaw Laboratories, and explained certain spots in
                        the right background as being remnants of a window. Such a conclusion has been disproven by
                        Bull, Pietro C. Marani and others. In light of this revision—with the primary damage being
                        overpaint in the background—the art historian Martin Kemp noted that "the picture is in much
                        better condition than the standard accounts suggest, and gives the clearest indication of the
                        freshly brilliant quality of Leonardo's painting during his period at the Sforza court in
                        Milan".</p>

                        Depicted in sumptuous clothes and jewellery, with her left hand Mary holds a carnation (red,
                        suggesting blood and the Passion). The faces are put into light while all other objects are
                        darker, e.g. the flower is covered by a shadow. The child is looking up and the mother looking
                        down, with no eye contact. The setting of the portrait is a room with two windows on each side
                        of the figures. </p>

                    <p>Originally this painting was thought to have been created by Andrea del Verrocchio, but
                        subsequent art historians agree that it is Leonardo's work, probably made during his
                        apprenticeship to Verrocchio. The Virgin's hair, left hand, the drapery, and flowers are similar
                        to elements of Leonardo's Annunciation.</p>
