                <div class="col-12 col-lg-4">
                    <p>The Feast of the Gods is an oil painting by the Italian Renaissance master Giovanni Bellini, with
                        substantial additions in stages to the left and center landscape by Dosso Dossi and Titian. It
                        is one of the few mythological pictures by the Venetian artist. Completed in 1514, it was his
                        last major work. It is now in the National Gallery of Art in Washington D.C., which calls it
                        "one of the greatest Renaissance paintings in the United States".</p>

                    <p>The painting is the first major depiction of the subject of the "Feast of the Gods" in
                        Renaissance art, which was to remain in currency until the end of Northern Mannerism over a
                        century later. It has several similarities to another, much less sophisticated, treatment
                        painted by the Florentine artist Bartolomeo di Giovanni in the 1490s, now in the Louvre.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="col-12 col-lg-8 article-paragraph-margin">
                    <h3 class="display-2">Subject | Interpretation</h3>
                    <p>The work is atypical of Renaissance mythological painting in the down to earth treatment of the
                        main deities, which may be accounted for by the figures beginning as ordinary citizens of
                        Thebes, and by Bellini's inexperience in the emerging conventions of mythological art. The work
                        was a considerable departure from his usual subject-matter of religious scenes and portraits for
                        Bellini, who was over 80 when he began it.</p>

                    <p>The painting shows the incident of the attempted rape of Lotis. She was a nymph, mentioned by
                        Ovid, the daughter of Neptune or Nereus. During a festival in honor of Liber that she attended,
                        Priapus tried to rape her while she was asleep, but she was awakened by a sudden cry of
                        Silenus's ass and ran off, leaving Priapus in embarrassment as everyone else woke up too and
                        became aware of his intentions. The story is shown at the edges of the composition, in a
                        somewhat undramatic fashion presumably showing a moment shortly before the key incident, with
                        Silenus and his ass at left and Priapus and Lotis at right (and everyone but Lotis still wide
                        awake). The subject had been depicted in the first illustrated edition of Ovid in Italian,
                        published in Venice in 1497.</p>

                    <p>The figures shown are usually taken to be (left to right): a satyr, Silenus with his ass, his
                        ward Bacchus as a boy, Silvanus (or Faunus), Mercury with his caduceus and helmet, a satyr,
                        Jupiter, a nymph serving, Cybele, Pan, Neptune, two standing nymphs, Ceres, Apollo, Priapus,
                        Lotis. Some of the figures may be portraits of people at the Ferrara court, including Alfonso
                        and his wife Lucrezia Borgia.</p>

                    <p>Another suggestion is that the couple in the center, the male with his hand between the female's
                        thighs, are a bridal pair, as shown by their intimacy and the quince she is holding, a fruit
                        recommended for brides. If he is still Neptune, this would make her Amphitrite.</p>

                <div class="col-12 col-lg-4">
                    <p>For Giovanni Bellini and his busy workshop, devotional images of the Virgin and Child were
                        mainstays. Between about 1460 and 1500 they painted countless half-length Madonnas,
                        revolutionizing the image in the process. Rather than faithfully copy the look of the old
                        Madonnas, Bellini attempted a “spiritual likeness.”</p>

                    <p>10 Bellini’s works share with icons a sense of monumentality, isolation, and austerity. Above
                        all, it is Bellini’s use of light that conveys the mood, luminosity evokes a numinous presence.
                        His figures are radiant, his landscapes lit by a dawn glow, light fills the entire space of his
                        compositions. Bellini was among the first to master the new techniques of oil painting, which
                        made this brilliant color possible.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="col-12 col-lg-8 article-paragraph-margin">
                    <h3 class="display-2">The idea</h3>
                    <p>The Virgin’s oval face, arched brows, and long, elegant features are similar to those of a
                        Byzantine Madonna. So is the rounded contour of the mantle drawn low over her brow. The child’s
                        body and energetic posture, however, do not at all recall the way icon painters presented the
                        infant Jesus—as a miniature adult in a regal, frontal pose. Here he steps onto the parapet as
                        his mother wraps him protectively in her cloak. She looks out pensively to the viewer
                        communicating the sad knowledge of her child’s future sacrifice, which he too appears to
                        consider, with a sidelong gaze. Bellini achieves the spiritual power of an icon with the
                        radiance of the figures, who seem almost to glow with an internal light.</p>

                    <p>Beginning around 1500, Bellini painted fewer images of the Virgin and Child alone and instead
                        added saints on either side. Essentially, these compositions were reduced versions of the sacra
                        conversazione, a type especially popular for altarpieces. In the 1520s the sacra conversazione
                        was the most common sort of painting in Venice. It's wider horizontal format invited
                        experimentation with scenes that depicted the Virgin and Child set within a landscape, sometimes
                        at three-quarter or even full length.</p>

                    <p>Giovanni Bellini would paint St Jerome several times, but this version, now in Birmingham, is
                        thought to be, not only his first depiction of the saint, but his earliest surviving work. While
                        there is uncertainty about the picture’s date, experts all agree that this is a work from
                        Bellini’s youth.</p>

                    <p>The young Bellini presents us with a very simple but beautiful image of faith, compassion and a
                        harmony between the natural world and humanity. It is worth looking at this image online and
                        those distant hills to see how wonderfully Bellini shows us the beauty of the natural world.</p>

                    <p>St. Jerome in the Wilderness is an on wood painting by Giovanni Bellini, now in the Barber
                        Institute of Fine Arts in Birmingham, England. Universally recognised as Bellini's earliest
                        surviving work, it depicts Saint Jerome shown seated on a rock in front of his cave in the
                        Syrian Desert with a book in his left hand, referring to his life as a hermit and as the
                        producer of the Vulgate Bible, and his faithful lion in front of him.</p>

                    <p>Saint Jerome was a scholar who translated the Bible into Latin. He also retired to the wilderness
                        and lived the secluded of a hermit. According to legend, he removed a thorn from the paw of a
                        lion who then became his companion. Here, Jerome exchanges the scholar’s study for a cave.
                        Beyond is a sunlit landscape full of closely-observed natural details representing the
                        comfortable life he has forsaken and the future he will gain.</p>

                    <p>Giovanni Bellini played a crucial role in the development of Venetian painting, introducing a
                        glowing use of colour and a new feeling for landscape.</p>

                    <p>Often resurrection scenes seem a bit awkward, but here it's the opposite. Nothing is forced or
                        contrived. Figure and landscape blend like a seamless garment. This is Bellini at his best.</p>

                    <p>A contemporary poet lamented that had a figure of Christ been painted by Bellini, rather than by
                        a lesser artist, it would’ve been “much more human and more divine”. Bellini sets before us a
                        figure of Risen Christ in which humanity, divinity and the whole creation co-exist beautifully.

                    <p>The portrait depicts Jesus Christ, raising his right hand while gripping a red staff with the
                        other. Christ's wounds are slightly visible on his hand as well as his chest. The shadows
                        indicate the reality of his Resurrection.</p>

                    <p>Meanwhile, the landscape in the background contains many motifs signifying the Resurrection. The
                        withered tree and solitary bird on the left of the panel represent the Old Covenant, out of
                        which the New Covenant will grow. The pair of rabbits in the lower left corner are symbols of
                        regeneration, and the three robed figures in the lower right corner are the Three Marys. The
                        bell tower in the distance conveys the message that salvation can be found through Christ and
                        the Church. Although the species is not very clear, the bird has been said to be a magpie, a
                        species also featured in Pieter Bruegel the Elder's The Magpie on the Gallows (1568).</p>

                    <p>The work was mentioned in 1648 by writer and painter Carlo Ridolfi as a large panel commissioned
                        in memory of Venetian politician and diplomat Pietro Cappello; he described it as "one of the
                        most beautiful and delicate by the artist".</p>

                    <p>It is Bellini's first work in which the influence of Giorgione is undeniable, starting the last
                        phase in the artist's career, a tonalist one.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="col-12 col-lg-8 article-paragraph-margin">
                    <h3 class="display-2">Subject | Interpretation</h3>
                    <p>The work is set in a large niche, depicting a sacred conversation within an established scheme:
                        the Madonna and Child enthroned, a musician angel on a step and four saints placed symmetrically
                        at the sides. They are St. Peter the Apostle, St. Catherine of Alexandria, St. Lucy and St.
                        Jerome.</p>

                    <p>While the general ensemble is not different from previous works, such as the San Giobbe
                        Altarpiece (which shares the apse with mosaics, for example), Bellini introduced some novelties,
                        such as the side openings with landscape, inspired by Alvise Vivarini Battutii Altarpiece, once
                        in Belluno (now lost). The colors and light show the new adherence of Bellini to Giorgione's
                        color and mood style. The egg above Mary's head is a symbol of the creation, perhaps a citation
                        of Piero della Francesca's Brera Altarpiece. The lucerne below recalls Andrea Mantegna's San
                        Zeno Altarpiece.</p>

                    <p>In this painting Bellini used a combination of oil and tempera paints, perhaps having been under
                        the influence of Antonello da Messina.The painting shows the influence of Andrea Mantegna, who
                        was the painter's brother-in-law. However, the original painting would not be much larger than
                        the present by estimation. Though it has been cut down, it has otherwise been well-cared for
                        since its creation.</p>

                </div>

                <div class="col-12 col-lg-8 article-paragraph-margin">
                    <h3 class="display-2">Idea | Interpretation</h3>
                    <p>The painting contains a strong effect of mystical light through the use of golden rays coming
                        from the uppermost left corner of the painting, showering over Saint Francis. His brighter body
                        contrasts with the darker environment of the painting. In the foreground, the focus is on a
                        stony, dangerous, dark, and mossy cave with a shady entrance covered by twisted grapevines.
                        Inside the cave, several possessions of the saint are represented, including a Holy Book, desk,
                        hermit’s skull, a thorny crown, and a crucifix made of stems. Although the scene is rocky, it
                        does not look infertile. The landscape depicts a transformation into spring through the
                        inclusion of growing grass.</p>

                    <p>The painting depicts St. Francis having come out of his cave in a brown traditional robe,
                        standing barefooted, looking upwards at paradise with widely opened arms and heaving chest. The
                        rocks around him in the painting are converting into a stream, implying that his life has just
                        transformed. In the painting, a mystical light is showered over St. Francis; he seems to be
                        absorbing this light and spreading it throughout the entire painting.</p>
